-Dammit... no air conditioning. What the hell am I doing here?
-I oughta quit...
-Don't leave me here guys!

SKSSH SKSSH SKSSH

-Okay, I oughta be pretty hard to spot in daylight like this...
-I'm just not cut out for this round-the-clock observation...
-hmm... pressure sensitive triggers and a gorgon mine? Or is it a dummy...?
-Either way, what a waste! I oughta take it home as a souvenir...

-Gorgon mine: an english-type anti-personnel canister mine that
jumps up about two metters when triggered and then scatters(scattered) 
around a hundred mini-mines (triggered two seconds after landing by any vibration occuring within a three meter radius)

-SNAP

-Psst, it's me...

-CHAK

-Well, see anything?

-After thirty-two hours on stakeout, I've had two phone calls, and that's all... no replacement, no pizza, no nothing...

-Well, here, have a swig...

-Don't mind if I do...

-just as one of our korean sources warned... the "puppeteer" has started to meddle with each terminal in the network.

-You mean the mystery "super hacker"...? That's got something to do with this stake-out?
-Hey! Didyou water this stuff down?

[Page 54]-->Select 56pg-doc!
-From the looks of it, they're planning on interfering with the secret meeting with the gavel republic...

-Well, in that case, TI's hardly a secret meeting is it...
-So, I'm staking out somdebody who leaked the info on the meeting eh? The guy who tried to interfere by hiring the "puppeteer"?
-He's just the leader of the military government, applying for asylum... that's all.
-You came out here just to tell me that?

-Of course not! I want you to call major kusanagi on your encrypted channel. Tell her to report to flat #17!

-But she's on R&R, chief...

-Well, it's cancelled...

-Uh-oh...

[Page 55]-->Select 57pg-doc!
-OH! -OH! -OH! -AH! -AH!

-Woa! What's that?

-AH! -AH! -OH!

Bato thinks this because he perceives a great quantity of information. A computerized sexual act is not simple:
It is obtained from the use of different programs at the same time. The drawings are purely representative, just to avoid
expressing difficult concepts. The blue liquid represents a program for increasing sensitivity

-Maybe some kind of drug?
-Woa!

[Page 56]-->Select 58pg-doc!
-But where is phalanx?

-She's been arrested by the "anti-edorno" detector

-AH!

-We'll have to increase its prize

-Yeh it's very exciting

-If there was a device with 16²/cm² elements of epidermic sensitivity maybe I could copy it!
-If it was formed by optic fibers the electromagnetic pertubations wouldn't be a problem

-A person has 10-16 cm sensitivity points to pain. 25cm to pressure, 6-23cm to cold and 0-3cm to hot temperatures

-Now we'll turn to multi and begin to record, ok?

-UN! -AH! -AH!

-By the way, where did that equalizer come from? It multiplies by five the transformation limits of sensitivity

-I programmed it. It's an experimental product for applying the microslave

[Page 57]-->Select 59pg-doc!
-HH? NKK...

-Jezz, it's so hot and humid there... gimme a break, major!
-And I get seasick easily...
-Orgg... I feel nauseous... this is just too much--
-WHOK
-Major! You've been summoned to #17! Chief's order!

-Tell the old fart I'll be there in 20 minutes!

-Motoko, how could you!? This always happens, but still--you promised to spend your leave with us!

-Well, the drug's locked out now, and my leave's been cancelled...

-Hey, don't take the equalizer...! 

-When you leave make sure you lock the door. I'll call you latter... ta ta!

-WHUP WHUP WHUP WHUP
-WHUP WHUP

-Well, mr. Aramaky--you need something from the foreign ministry?

-Good morning sir!
-It's about the gavel republic sir..

-It could hardly be that important. We've given gavel an "e" ranking--6 for need, 1 for problems...
... and they haven't gone nuclear yet.
-Both economically and in terms of our foreign policy, they're a tiny, low-priority country. Used to be a military 
government but they've been fairly democratic since the revolution...
-As I recall, one of your men was in charge of teaching tactics to the troops in the revolution...

-That a fact?

-Colonel Malles, the boss of the former military government, is in our country now, supposedly seeking "medical 
treatment..."

-...but he's still sending aid to the military forces in his country. As a result, the forces under his influence still
control the platinum deposits there.

[Page 59]-->Select 61 pg-doc!
-... and the secret meeting?

-It's just the oda spinning its wheels.
-It doesn't earn any of the money it uses after all. And nobody receiving it feels grateful, either, because they think
they deserve it after being exploited...

-Tough situation, isn't it? You know the mass media's going to leak some off-the-record statements...
-So what's the government's position?

-Gavel's in an extraordinary delicate position right now. If we're not careful, it'll be hard to control public opinion.
-Either we kick out colonel Malles and continue to promote aid to the current government of Gavel, or we officially give
him asylum and stop all aid...

-It sure would be interesting to keep a close eye on the flow of that platinum money...

-Ah, but we have to be careful not to waste taxpayers' funds.
-Hmph... some "representative of the people." wonder why it always comes down to money...?
-Now, there is someone who did give considerable guidance to the milirary government on tactics...

-Wha-?!

-We've got special jurisdiction here... no agents from intelligence allowed!

-Breaker!

-Okay.

-Beep -Beep

-Simex mode?

-Done.

-Beep Beep

-You're in the way, pal...!

-Shit!

-That's the foreign minister's interpreter.

-I know... she and one of my men, Togusa, used to be an item.

-A virus infiltrated her twenty-three minutes ago, and now we're trying to trace it back to the source and identify who did it.

[Page 61]-->Select 63 pg-doc!
-That's amazing... how was it discovered that a virus had been infiltrated in the first place?!

-It's a victory for intelligence... it set a net and just waited...

-With a trap set, and after twenty-three minutes, I still hasn't got them?

-The perp likes to move around.
-He changes location and every seven minutes infiltrates for five seconds each.
-So in other words, she's going to participate in this dangerous game for us until we catch who did it, eh?

-When'll the virus reach her ghost?

-It's an ha-3.

-Hmm... so a bit over two hours.

-Ishikawa and Boma are in a car right now, trying to nail down the perp's location. I want you to rendezvous with them!

[Page 62]-->Select 64 pg-doc!
-Ya gotta tell me, major... I heard this from Mayumi, in security's armory, but I don't bel--

-You mean that she's really sixty-two years old?

-What? No shit!

-So is it really true she can hit a pinhead with a 3.5" barrel seburo™ snab at 25 yards, firing twelve rounds in three 
seconds?
-Hey, Togusa, everyone can do that... except you and Saito.
-Aw, c'mon... don't pick on me major.

-With the human silhouettes she usually hits the mark at 100 yards.
-Snabs are really designed to be used against the enemy at under five yards, but there's nothing that special about 
what she can do...

-But I've never even seen anyone do that at the shooting range! 'Course, I'm not special "a" rank myself...

-What we really need, Togusa, is not sharpshooting skills, so much as the ability to get close enough to make sure the
enemy can be killed.
-If you want to play at long-range sniping, you can always go shoot an elephant at 500 miles with a miniature cruise
missile...

[Page 63]-->Select 65 pg-doc!
-By the way, why are you using a revolver for your main gun?
-CHAK
-In a two-man cell, aren't you afraid of it jamming, even if you're carrying two guns?

-I happen to like the M2007!

-Seburo™ C-25: Think of it as an FN P90 with a lower magazine!

-Well, as the one being backed-up, I'm more interested in being protected than in what gun you like best...
-I'm the one in the line of fire, after all. Do me a favor, Togusa, and carry a 20-shot, 5mm Seburo™...

-Yeah, yeah... shit.

-And what the hell's this? This AS-11 shotgun's got a short range and can't even penetrate a car door! What good is it?
Don't expect it to have any psychological effect on a pro, and for anything over 30 yards, you need an assault rifle
anyway...

-Hey, it'll go through a mercedes door--I've got it filled with slugs.
-And indoors I can use it to blast a hole in walls...

-Sure you're not confusing hunting humans with making mincemeat?
-For close-range work and piercing power use the Seburo™, for walls and distance use a rifle!

-Still, I really think I could use it...

-Well, this time you won't need it.

-We're tracing the hacker that infiltrated the foreign minister's interpreter.
-His interpreter?! You mean--!!!?

[Page 64]-->Select 66 pg-doc!
-VRMMMM
-Don't worry, Togusa. It's only two hours.
-In other words, two hours from now we'll be able to cut the circuit to protect her from the HA-3
-We've got until then to retrace the signal to find our man.

-"HA-3"...? 

-It's some sort of military AI created during world war IV...

-But why the hell use something like that on her now?
-Bastards!

-Hey, eyes on the road!

-In the old days, Asia and the EEC used different cyberbrain standards, and the HA-3 was only used by the enemy...
-...but after the war, it formed a unified standard that worked with all machines.

[Page 65]-->Select 67 pg-doc!
-So what kind of virus is it?

-KLIK

-It's a personahijacker model. Alone it's harmless, but with the right genomes, it goes to work.
-Recent models have a delay built in. Once they've infiltrated, they can't be traced back.
-Good thing this is an old type.

-What's so goddamn "good" about it?!

-Relax, Togusa... she's going to be all right.

-But what sort of asshole would do something like that to a sweet kid like her?

-Your sentiments are touching, Togusa, but keep 'em on hold for now, okay?

-Hey, I'm not a robot, major.

-Ha!
-That's why you're still a rookie...

-After this, there's a scene where Mokoto takes over the driving and Togusa checks his gear and puts it on, but it was
too much of a hassle to draw so I left it out...

-Christ, no matter how much we collect, they keep making more...

--So I never get to see my kids, and my wife threatens me with divorce...

-She prob'ly thinks you're cheating on her...

-Yeah, well, I'm worried about her...

-VRMMM

-Holy shit! Now that's going too far!

-Looks like someone had quite a party...

-If we were running restaurant row and it looked like this, we'd be dead...

-Step on it!

-VRMM

-VVRMMM SKREEEEE

-Dammit! We'll never make it on time!

-The whole thing's stupid... even if we trace the infiltrator, by the time we get there he'll be gone...

-Too much bitching'll negatively impact your eval and bonus, boys!
-But chief, why don't you just fry him with an attack barrier?!

-Major Kusanagi's headed for the next location. I want you boys to look for something...

-Like what?! 

-Like anything!

-No organic garbage and no toxic waste allowed!

-Goddamn old fart! What the hell does he want us to do? Just snoop around?

-Wait a sec...

-Say... where's the garbage truck...?

-Hey, pops! You see one o'them sanitation vehicles around here?

-You folks from the garbage department?

[Page 72]-->Select 74 pg-doc!
-I'm just asking if you saw one or not!

-Yup, I saw one, but by the time I got out here with my trash it was gone.
-One of them was carrying garbage, but the others was making a phone call...

-SKREEE

-Hey, wait! Take this--huh... damn garbage men these days...
