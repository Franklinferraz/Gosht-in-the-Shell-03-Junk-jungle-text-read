-Dammit... no air conditioning. What the hell am I doing here?
-I oughta quit...
-Don't leave me here guys!

SKSSH SKSSH SKSSH

-Okay, I oughta be pretty hard to spot in daylight like this...
-I'm just not cut out for this round-the-clock observation...
-hmm... pressure sensitive triggers and a gorgon mine? Or is it a dummy...?
-Either way, what a waste! I oughta take it home as a souvenir...

-Gorgon mine: an english-type anti-personnel canister mine that
jumps up about two metters when triggered and then scatters(scattered) 
around a hundred mini-mines (triggered two seconds after landing by any vibration occuring within a three meter radius)

-SNAP

-Psst, it's me...

-CHAK

-Well, see anything?

-After thirty-two hours on stakeout, I've had two phone calls, and that's all... no replacement, no pizza, no nothing...

-Well, here, have a swig...

-Don't mind if I do...

-just as one of our korean sources warned... the "puppeteer" has started to meddle with each terminal in the network.

-You mean the mystery "super hacker"...? That's got something to do with this stake-out?
-Hey! Didyou water this stuff down?

-From the looks of it, they're planning on interfering with the secret meeting with the gavel republic...

-Well, in that case, TI's hardly a secret meeting is it...
-So, I'm staking out somdebody who leaked the info on the meeting eh? The guy who tried to interfere by hiring the "puppeteer"?
-He's just the leader of the military government, applying for asylum... that's all.
-You came out here just to tell me that?

-Of course not! I want you to call major kusanagi on your encrypted channel. Tell her to report to flat #17!

-But she's on R&R, chief...

-Well, it's cancelled...

-Uh-oh...

-OH! -OH! -OH! -AH! -AH!

-Woa! What's that?

-AH! -AH! -OH!

Bato thinks this because he perceives a great quantity of information. A computerized sexual act is not simple:
It is obtained from the use of different programs at the same time. The drawings are purely representative, just to avoid
expressing difficult concepts. The blue liquid represents a program for increasing sensitivity

-Maybe some kind of drug?
-Woa!

-But where is phalanx?

-She's been arrested by the "anti-edorno" detector

-AH!

-We'll have to increase its prize

-Yeh it's very exciting

-If there was a device with 16²/cm² elements of epidermic sensitivity maybe I could copy it!
-If it was formed by optic fibers the electromagnetic pertubations wouldn't be a problem

-A person has 10-16 cm sensitivity points to pain. 25cm to pressure, 6-23cm to cold and 0-3cm to hot temperatures

-Now we'll turn to multi and begin to record, ok?

-UN! -AH! -AH!

-By the way, where did that equalizer come from? It multiplies by five the transformation limits of sensitivity

-I programmed it. It's an experimental product for applying the microslave

-HH? NKK...

-Jezz, it's so hot and humid there... gimme a break, major!
-And I get seasick easily...
-Orgg... I feel nauseous... this is just too much--
-WHOK
-Major! You've been summoned to #17! Chief's order!

-Tell the old fart I'll be there in 20 minutes!

-Motoko, how could you!? This always happens, but still--you promised to spend your leave with us!

-Well, the drug's locked out now, and my leave's been cancelled...

-Hey, don't take the equalizer...! 

-When you leave make sure you lock the door. I'll call you latter... ta ta!
